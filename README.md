Request Header Parser Microservice project for the Freecodecamp's Back End Development and APIs course. See below the Requirement specification for the project, which can also be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/request-header-parser-microservice

## Request Header Parser Microservice
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://request-header-parser-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/. Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

* Clone this GitHub repo and complete your project locally.
* Use our Replit starter project to complete your project.
* Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

If you use Replit, follow these steps to set up the project:

* Start by importing the project on Replit.
* Next, you will see a .replit window.
* Select Use run command and click the Done button.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.

## Tests

* You should provide your own project, not the example URL.
* A request to /api/whoami should return a JSON object with your IP address in the ipaddress key.
* A request to /api/whoami should return a JSON object with your preferred language in the language key.
* A request to /api/whoami should return a JSON object with your software in the software key.
